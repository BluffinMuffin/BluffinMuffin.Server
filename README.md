Poker Server that Implements [BluffinMuffin.Protocol](http://ericmas001.github.io/BluffinMuffin.Protocol/).

It all started as a java school project in 2010. Since then, project migred to C#. In 2015, [BluffinMuffin.Beta](http://ericmas001.github.io/BluffinMuffin.Beta/) was splitted in distinct project. This is the new project for the Server. It will implement BluffinMuffin.Protocol and grow as an independant entity.
